# <center>The Collection</center>
Archive of Malware Leaks from around the internet

 - Botnets
 - Ebooks
 - Exploit Kits
 - Source Code's
 And others.
 
I've tried my best to remove any passwords from the archives and too make sure nothing is infected.

**I don't guarantee the "safeness" of any of the archives, builders, eBooks and anything in this repo, while you should be safe i reccomend using a VM or Sandbox**

If you're going to add an archive, eBook or other to the repo please make sure the archive is passwordless or the password is "TheCollection" also try your best to make sure your contrubution isn't infected.
